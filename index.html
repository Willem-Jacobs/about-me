        <h3>My Goals</h3>
        <p>
          My goals are to retire from the Port Authority soon and go back into
          programming work. I would either like to work remote while still
          living in the Cayman Islands or to freelance for myself. I always had
          a passion for coding as I did it for many years before moving to upper
          management so I want to return to it. You can say this my mid-life
          crises wanting to return to my roots & passion.
