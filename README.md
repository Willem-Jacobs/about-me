# LAB - 2, 3, 4, and 5b

## About Me

- The main page displays some facts about myself, education & work experience.
- It then goes on to ask the user a series of questions that need to be answered with a Yes/No or Y/N. The code will convert the values to lowercase to ensure proper checking of the entered value.
- Series of checks are done using IF ELSE statements to provide an answer for the YES and for the NO entered value.
- Console.log statements remain, commented out, as requested.
- Prompt statement is used to ask the questions and Alert is used to display back to the user.

### New features added for lab 3

- User Story 1 - Added a ordered list to the HTML to show the top 10 countries I have visited.
- User Story 2 - Question 6 added to be a guess for a random number with 4 attempts. First version the number was fixed but it now makes a random number between 1-10 **(Stretch Goal).**
- User Story 3 - Question 7 added to use an array of possible answers and takes the guess from the user loops over the array to check if valid answer. Converts all answers to lower case as the array is lower case.
- User has 6 attempts to guess a valid answer in the array. If the user does not enter an answer, they forfit a turn. Once 1 guess is correct from the array of possible answers, it exits the loops using a label and informs the user they guessed correct. It also shows all the possible answers from the array.
- User Story 4 - Added the score option to all questions and displays the score on most alerts as the game goes on.
- Adjusted the CSS change colors, fixe footer to fixed position, centered boxes.

### New Feauters added for lab 4

- Pair programming with Heather Bisgaard (Driver). I was navigator.
  - For driver to get the code, the are provided the link.
  - Driver goes to that Repo and forks it to their GitHub.
  - Driver copies the clone link.
  - Driver goes to the folder in terminal where the local git will be made.
  - Driver does a clone of the PR from GitHun to their git.
  - Driver changes to directory and can edit the code as needed.
  - Driver to ACP as required. Once last one is done then:
- To send code back to the Navigator from the Driver and udpate the Navigator Repo.
  - Driver creates a Pull Request from the Repo.
  - Navigator will go the the Repo and confirm/merge the code.
  - Navigator to update git on local machine will go to terminal and directory to do a git pull origin branch (git pull origin main).
- Converted the questions to funcitons.

## Stretch Goals for lab 4

- Stretch 1 completed.
- Stretch 2 completed. Used a switch statement for this example that worked cleaner and better than a series of IF statements doing various checks.

### New Featuers added for lab 5b

- Stretch goal #2 completed. (cf.wjedev.ky) will take you to the AWS S3 for the page.

### Reflections and Comments

- Lab 4 stretch goal #2 was a nice challange to make the code compact and simple to read.
- Lab 5b. Setup my own domain (wjedev.ky) to use for different projects. Linked it to the AWS S3.
