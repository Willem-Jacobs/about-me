# LAB - 2, 3, 4, and 5b

## About Me

- The main page displays some facts about myself, education & work experience.
- It then goes on to ask the user a series of questions that need to be answered with a Yes/No or Y/N. The code will convert the values to lowercase to ensure proper checking of the entered value.
- Series of checks are done using IF ELSE statements to provide an answer for the YES and for the NO entered value.
- Console.log statements remain, commented out, as requested.
- Prompt statement is used to ask the questions and Alert is used to display back to the user.

### New features added for lab 3

- User Story 1 - Added a ordered list to the HTML to show the top 10 countries I have visited.
- User Story 2 - Question 6 added to be a guess for a random number with 4 attempts. First version the number was fixed but it now makes a random number between 1-10 **(Stretch Goal).**
- User Story 3 - Question 7 added to use an array of possible answers and takes the guess from the user loops over the array to check if valid answer. Converts all answers to lower case as the array is lower case.
- User has 6 attempts to guess a valid answer in the array. If the user does not enter an answer, they forfit a turn. Once 1 guess is correct from the array of possible answers, it exits the loops using a label and informs the user they guessed correct. It also shows all the possible answers from the array.
- User Story 4 - Added the score option to all questions and displays the score on most alerts as the game goes on.
