## About Me

- The main page displays some facts about myself, education & work experience.
- It then goes on to ask the user a series of questions that need to be answered with a Yes/No or Y/N. The code will convert the values to lowercase to ensure proper checking of the entered value.
- Series of checks are done using IF ELSE statements to provide an answer for the YES and for the NO entered value.
- Console.log statements remain, commented out, as requested.
- Prompt statement is used to ask the questions and Alert is used to display back to the user.
